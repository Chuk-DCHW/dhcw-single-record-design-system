# Patterns

Patterns are composed UI solutions built from components. They solve recurring design problems consistently across products.

A pattern is not a component — it describes how components work together to solve a specific user need.

## Adding a New Pattern

1. Confirm the problem cannot be solved with an existing pattern or component combination
2. Create a DDR if the pattern involves a non-trivial interaction decision
3. Create `/patterns/{category}/{pattern-name}.md` using the template at `/docs/templates/pattern-template.md`
4. Reference the components used
5. Update the catalogue above
